# Tesla Prototype

This applications is prototype of Tesla's website using a Flask framework and a full stack solution. 

Prior to running the application, users will need to set up three servers: Server1, Server2, and Server3. Server1 will support the frontend, Server2 will server as the middleware, and Server3 supports the database. 

Make sure to change the Public IPv4 DNS for Server1 and Server2 to SSH into the application as well as Server1's Public IP address in the app.py so the application can run in your browser. Users will also need to install python, jinja, and pymongo prior to running the application.

Use Server1's Public IPv4 address in your browser (e.g., http://Server1IP)
